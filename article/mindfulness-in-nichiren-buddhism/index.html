                    <p>Mindfulness is about “awareness of the moment”.  It focuses on breathing, attention to the surrounding, as well as awareness of the inner thoughts of the mind.  It is basically about passively observing the mind, accepting it as it is. </p>
<p>Chanting is also about “awareness of the moment” and its implication on one’s life.  It automatically and effortlessly harmonises the rhythm of breathing and the rhythm of heart beat.  Harmony of those physiological functions dissolves tension, and this can be visibly noticed on the face features of individuals after chanting.</p>
<p>Voice implies leadership of the self, and chanting gives the mind a direction towards revealing the Buddhanature (encoded by the phrase of chanting).  In effect, one can experience inner harmony, clarity of mind and empowerment.</p>
<p>The word Ichinen used in Nichiren Buddhism describes both mindfulness of the moment as well as determination to lead one’s life towards desired goal, it is mindfulness with a clear direction.</p>
<p>Facing our weaknesses, realising our potentials and finding solutions</p>
<p>How different is chanting from meditation and “positive thinking”?</p>
<p>“Chanting is neither meditation, nor positive thinking, though it reaps the benefits of both these practices and much more. The essence of chanting Nam-myoho-renge-kyo is that in the very act of doing so we are expressing our Buddha nature.</p>
<p>Meditation and positive thinking do not have Buddhahood as their objective.  It is not possible to express Buddhahood through these means.  Although meditation and positive thinking may have value - they cannot change the fundamental element in our lives, which makes us unhappy and unfulfilled as human beings — our karma, nor can they bring out the highest condition of life, Buddhahood.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Meditation is a more passive exercise than chanting; one usually calms one’s mind by concentrating on a particular thought or image.  At first glance this may seem close to the practice of Nichiren Daishonin’s Buddhism, but actually the difference is apparent.  The practice of chanting Nam-myoho-renge-kyo enables us to express and experience our innate Buddhahood and release the powerful energy contained within that, rather than to calm our minds or negate certain ways of thinking.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Again, while it is true that our thinking does become more positive as a result of chanting, this is because chanting draws out our Buddhahood which, in turn, influences every aspect of our lives, both mental and physical.</p>
<p>Therefore, chanting is not so much a question of “thinking positively” or exercising “mind over matter,” which implies restriction; rather, through chanting, our highest state of life naturally influences our thoughts and actions towards the most valuable ends”.</p>

<p>Mindfulness in Nichiren Buddhism: Ichinen</p>
<p>Mindfulness practices are being used more frequently—in schools, at work, as part of therapy and even in prison—to help people better recognize their thoughts and feelings as they grapple with the complex challenges of daily life.</p>
<p>Mindfulness is also incorporated in the practice of Nichiren Buddhism, which focuses on unlocking the power to master our minds and transform our negative tendencies.</p>
<p>“Mindfulness” can be traced back to the Sanskrit word smrti, generally understood to mean a presence of mind, awareness or the ability to recollect. Smrti was often translated into Chinese Buddhist texts as nian (念), or nen in Japanese—a character made up of two radicals meaning “now” and “mind”.</p>
<p>Since the “mind” in Nichiren Buddhism encompasses the entirety of our thoughts, emotions and intent, “nen” or mindfulness points to the state of our life at this present moment.</p>
<p>Nichiren’s belief was that one’s ichinen (一念), often translated as “a single moment of life” or “single-minded determination,” possessed the key to revealing the boundless Buddha nature within life. It was Nichiren’s single-minded determination to lead all people to enlightenment that enabled him to exhibit the state of Buddhahood as an ordinary human being.</p>
<p>SGI President Ikeda elaborates on the concept of ichinen, or single-minded determination:</p>
<p>        When your determination changes, everything else will begin to move in the direction you desire. The moment you resolve to be victorious, every nerve and fiber in your being will immediately orient itself toward your success. On the other hand, if you think, “This is never going to work out,” then, at that instant, every cell in your being will be deflated and give up the fight, and everything then really will move in the direction of failure . . .</p>
<p>How you orient your mind, the kind of attitude you take, greatly influences both yourself and your environment . . . Through the power of strong inner resolve, we can transform ourselves, those around us and the land in which we live. Each of you is in possession of this “tool,” this “secret weapon.” There is no greater treasure.    (July 11, 1997, World Tribune, p. 14)</p>
<p>By chanting to the Gohonzon each morning and evening, we are carrying out the most effective practice of mindfulness. By strengthening our resolve and deepening our capacity to respect ourselves and others, we find the wisdom to make the most of each moment and create the happiest of lives.</p>
