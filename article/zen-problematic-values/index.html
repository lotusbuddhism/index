<p>Zen  values  can be perceived from the essence of the information and messages contained in Zen literature - such as in koan. Obviously, a particular koan may describe a real event (which could have taken place in reality), but it may also express just a metaphor for the values (or essence), which the koan contains. In either case, the described statements in koans offer a glimpse into the qualities contained in the teachings of Zen masters as conveyed to disciples generation after the other.</p>
<p>Zen literature present a rich heritage of descriptions of events, which show lack of clarity about basic concepts in Buddhism (such as, for example: the Buddhanature). Regardless of theoretical beliefs - if any - many of Zen masters historical accounts imply an attitude of disrespect to others, bullying and violence.</p>
<ul>
<li>One of various bizarre events (proudly described in Zen literature) relates to a master  killing a cat  and another master putting his sandals over his head :<br>
<a href="https://www.zenfallacy.com/mental.html" title="https://www.zenfallacy.com/mental.html">Killing a Cat and Predicting the cat’s Enlightenment</a>.</li>
<li>Another proof of Zen masters immature behaviour and disrespect - is found in Zen proudly told story of “pinching a nun”  - when a Zen master pinched a nun as a way to “enlighten her to the truth”.</li>
<li>Zen does not shy from describing of bullying as a way to treat younger monks: for example recording how a master educated a younger monk by  slapping the face  (in reply to a question asked about Buddhism). Such juvenile behaviours or standards of presenting Zen values - show also the depth of arrogance and mental suppression Zen masters used towards young practitioners, who in turn became masters and treated their followers in a similar way. Reference to Zen literature describing such events is found in the following: <a href="https://www.zenfallacy.com/slap.html" title="https://www.zenfallacy.com/slap.html">https://www.zenfallacy.com/slap.html</a></li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>• An example of how Zen considers “values” in life - may be viewed through a question asked about what is value in Buddhism:</li>
</ol>
<p><a href="https://www.nichirenhumanism.com/lotus-buddhism/Zen_Dead_Cat.html" title="Zen_Dead_Cat.html">The Head of a Dead Cat</a>  : “A disciple asked the master: What is the most expensive thing in the world”? The master replied: “The head of a dead cat, because no body gives it a price”.</p>
<p>In his book  <a href="https://www.nichirenhumanism.com/lotus-buddhism/Koan_Book.html" title="Koan_Book.html">Pointing at the Moon</a>  , Alexander Holstein offers an explanation to the abovementioned koan, as being the master’s attempt to ‘shock the usual way of thinking’ of the questioner, and to teach his disciple to  “destroy the common values of ordinary mind”.</p>
<p>It is evident in this teaching, that the question of “what is  valuable?”  - was answered by the master through “what is not valuable” - however, more shocking is the commentator’s explanation about aiming to “destroy the values of ordinary mind” . Buddhism teaches, that the ordinary mind of common people (of the Nine Worlds) contains within it the Buddha mind or Buddhanature as well. The “common values  of ordinary mind” contain also humanistic values such as compassion, courage, seeking spirit, altruism, love…etc… common values which can be rather enriched through Buddhism - rather than “destroyed”.</p>
<p><strong>What is “valuable” in Buddhism ?</strong></p>
<p>The question (of what is the most precious thing in the world) was in fact about what is precious (sacred or divine) in Buddhism. This question was also treated by Nichiren, and he gave the following explanation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“One day of Life is more valuable than all the treasures of the major world system…<br>
A single life is worth more than the major world system”  <a href="https://www.nichirenlibrary.org/en/wnd-1/Content/129" title="https://www.nichirenlibrary.org/en/wnd-1/Content/129">WND1 p 955</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nichiren also refers to the value of a compassionate heart of ordinary people:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“More valuable than treasures in a storehouse are the treasures of the body,<br>
and the treasures of the heart are the most valuable of all.<br>
From the time you read this letter on, strive to accumulate the treasures of the heart”.<br>
<a href="https://www.nichirenlibrary.org/en/wnd-1/Content/106" title="https://www.nichirenlibrary.org/en/wnd-1/Content/106">WND1 p 851</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>SGI literature comments on these statements:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“When we base our values on the treasures of the heart [compassion], the true value<br>
and worth of the treasures of the storehouse [material wealth] and the body [health and<br>
skills] also become apparent in our lives.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In short, we need to make accumulating the treasures of the heart our fundamental purpose in life. If we lose sight of this elemental objective, but seek to accumulate the  treasures of the storehouse and the body – it will only give rise to attachment.</p>
<p>When that happens, fear of losing such material or physical treasures can become a cause of suffering.</p>
<p>It is therefore important above all to accumulate the treasures of the heart.</p>
<p>This reflects a correct sense of purpose in life.”<br>

<p><strong>Zen at War</strong></p>
<p>One of the basic differences between Nichiren Buddhism and Zen (as well as all other Buddhist traditions) - is their position and actions during the ii World War. While the founders of the Soka movement refused the demand of the authorities to declare their support for the war and emperor worship, Zen masters in particular issued and published books of support to the aggression and violence of the “Holy War”.</p>
<p>Zen masters regarded the war as “divine”, and the emperor as superior to the Buddha, and encouraged people to commit suicide as purification of their karma and serving the emperor: <a href="https://www.zenfallacy.com/crulety.html" title="https://www.zenfallacy.com/crulety.html">https://www.zenfallacy.com/crulety.html</a></p>
