      <description>Nichiren Buddhism is about revealing one’s potentials to live a happy meaningful life.
It is about empowering the individual to transform any situation or hardship into beneficial experience - helping others do the same.
What is the basic aim in Nichiren’s practice?
“How can I reveal my potentials to live a happy life, helping others do the same?” “How can I create valuable relationships, broadmindedness &amp;amp; open-heart?”. What is the basic belief in Nichiren’s Buddhism?</description>

      <description>Chanting is using one’s voice in self-empowerment to experience the highest state of mind. It is a practice that harmonises the physical and mental aspects of the individual.
Rhythmic chanting self-optimises the flow of two physiological functions of breathing and rhythm of heartbeat - and it creates a feeling of harmony and lack of tension. One’s voice carries within its physical vibrations the mental aspect of meaning and emotions. Through using one’s voice in chanting – the three elements of “body-mind-spirit” are integrated.</description>

      <description>1941
Division between Soka Kyoiku Gakkai and the priesthood surfaced because of the priesthood’s obedience to the authorities’ demands during the II World War to regard the Emperor as superior to the Buddha.
1952 After the war ended, the second president, Mr Toda was banned in 1952 from entering the Head Temple, because of Soka Gakkai’s youth demand of an apology from a priest who cooperated with the military authorities.</description>

      <description>Nichikan Shonin (1665 - 1726) - the 26 High Priest of Nichiren Shoshu – is known as the restorer of Nichiren teachings. Among his various works, clarifying the depth of Nichiren Buddhism, was his Six Treaties (Ha Rokkan Sho), lectures on the Heritage of the Law and clarifying the power of the Gohonzon:
&amp;ldquo;If you have faith in this Gohonzon and chant Nam-myoho-renge-kyo

      <description>Stagnation in the system of Nichiren ShoShu Priesthood in general - is revealed not only in the administrative part of authority they impose on ordinary people, but also in the field of their interpretation of Nichiren’s teachings. There is no doubt that priests undergo study sessions and have a lot of knowledge about Buddhism, however, some of priests knowledge can be challenged as based on superficial and shallow understanding of Nichiren’s teachings.</description>

      <description>During the II W W, the military authorities in Japan asked various Nichiren schools to delete passages from the Daishonin’s writings it viewed as disrespectful toward the emperor and the Shinto deity (The Military’s “Maintenance of the Public Order Act Against Blasphemy”) .
In June 1941, Nichiren Shu school decided to delete 208 phrases and passages from 70 of Nichiren’s writings.
Following the lead of Nichiren Shu, The Administrative Office of Nichiren Shoshu issued a notice (#2177), dated August 24, 1941, stating that:</description>

      <guid>https://lotusbuddhism.info/article/nichirin-shu-pre-lotus-interpretations/</guid>
      <description>Nichiren Shu scholars interpret the Lotus Sutra through incompatible concepts with the revolutionary nature of Sutra, as in the following:
The Bodhisattvas of the Lotus Sutra
While all Mahayana schools of Buddhism teach the ‘Bodhisattva way’, the Lotus Sutra is unique in its teaching of the concept of ‘Bodhisattva of the Earth’. Pre-Lotus teachings distinguish between two phases (or worlds) of ‘Bodhisattva’ and ‘Buddha’, setting many stages in between the two, and a lengthy time of practice (stretching over many lifetimes) to bridge the two worlds of Bodhisattva and Buddha.</description>

      <description>Understanding Nichiren’s identity has a great importance to all who regard him as the founder of their school of Buddhism. Various Nichiren sects show reluctance to identify their founder as a Buddha, based on the assumption that no one can equal Shakyamuni Buddha. Here, a question arises whether this perspective of considering Shakyamuni as the only Buddha - is consistent with the teaching of the Ten Worlds.
The Ten Worlds reduced to Nine: Nichiren teaches that the Ten Worlds apply to all human beings.</description>

      <description>In an exchange of views, which took place on Tricycle magazine online discussion - Rev. Myokei of Nichiren Shu states: ”it really doesn’t matter whether Nichiren Shonin is a Buddha”.
The question about their founder’s identity was presented to various Nichiren Shu scholars. Instead of an openminded answer, the question was dismissed and the subject was disregarded to escape answering - as being “not importnat”, although - as Nichiren writes - it was the most important matter of his whole life.</description>

      <description>The Priesthood
“The sanction of the High Priest is what makes the
attainment of Buddhahood possible”
NST News, Special Issue, p3
SGI
Nowhere in Nichiren’s teachings a statement is found that one’s
attainment of Buddhahood depends on the High Priest.
The attainment of Buddhahood is possible only through the
individual’s efforts in faith:
“What is most important is that, by chanting Nam-myoho-renge-kyo alone, you can attain Buddhahood. It will no doubt depend on the strength of your faith” WND1 p 832</description>

      <guid>https://lotusbuddhism.info/article/eternal-buddha-of-lotus-sutra/</guid>
      <description>The word “Buddha” is used in two contexts. It covers two meanings:
Buddha as a person, and
Buddha as a state of life. The Buddha “state of life” is the “world of Buddhahood”.
While the person of a Buddha means a physical manifestation of Buddhahood, the person cannot - of course - be eternal. The eternal is assigned not to the person, but to the “state of life” of Buddhahood. The state of “eternal Buddhahood” is necessarily not restricted by time or space.</description>

      <description>The Priesthood :
“Absolute Obedience” in the person of the High Priest should be the attitude of lay believers. (Source: DaiNichiren magazine, III, p. 13)
SGI :
The demand of “Strict Obedience and Absolute Faith” in the person of the High Priest goes against Nichiren’s teachings and against the admonitions of his successor, Nikko Shonin. High Priests can make disastrous mistakes. A clear example was Nikkyo, the High Priest who openly supported the aggression of the Japanese military during the II W War:</description>

      <description>The Priesthood
” To talk about the priesthood and laity with a sense of equality
are expressions of great conceit. In fact, they correspond to
the five cardinal sins…”
Nichiren Shoshu Head Temple&amp;rsquo;s chief administrator,
Nichijun Fujimoto, 12 Jan.1991.
SGI
On equality of all believers before the Law, Nichiren states:

“One should never worship anything as a Gohonzon
that has not been authorised by the High Priest, who
has inherited the Heritage of the Law, even if it was
inscribed by Nichiren Daishonin himself”
NST News, Special Issue, p3.

The power of the Gohonzon is activated by the practitioner’s faith,
not by the High Priest who inscribed it.

      <description>The changing landscape of Pure Land
The traditional view in Amitabha Buddhism maintains that salvation from sufferings is found after death :
“…chanting that Amitabha Buddha, through the strength of his vows, help us to be reborn in the Pure Land as we breathe our last breath in our present bodies”.
This view, however, is starting to fade in some Amida schools operating in East Asia through gradual acceptance of the concept of “Inherent Buddhanature”.</description>

      <title>Buddismo di Nichiren e Cristianesimo</title>
      <link>https://lotusbuddhism.info/article/buddismo-nichiren-cristianesimo/</link>

      <guid>https://lotusbuddhism.info/article/buddismo-nichiren-cristianesimo/</guid>
      <description>Le somiglianze in alcuni dei concetti tra credenze cristiane e buddismo sono state notate da diversi studiosi. In sostanza, il concetto cristiano di &amp;ldquo;Dio&amp;rdquo; e il concetto buddista della &amp;ldquo;Legge Universale&amp;rdquo; condividono molte caratteristiche, come &amp;ldquo;l&amp;rsquo;eterno&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;il potere creativo&amp;rdquo; e i &amp;ldquo;non nati&amp;rdquo;, così come le proprietà di &amp;ldquo;saggezza&amp;rdquo; e &amp;ldquo;compassione&amp;rdquo;.
Una delle principali differenze tra queste due filosofie, forse, è che &amp;ldquo;Dio&amp;rdquo; ha un carattere personificato nel cristianesimo (infatti Gli si fa riferimento come a un essere di sesso maschile), mentre nel Buddismo di Nichiren la &amp;ldquo;Legge Universale&amp;rdquo; non è legata ad un personaggio (pur avendo entrambe le qualità maschili e femminili) .</description>

      <description>In his interview with Tricycle magazine, Ikeda referred to the basic difference between Zen (and also Pure Land Buddhism) - and the Buddhism of the Lotus Sutra:
“The Zen practice of just sitting is representative of the kind of jiriki, or “self-power,” practice that makes no appeal to any kind of absolute truth or being beyond oneself.
On the other hand, the chanting of nembutsu, relying on and seeking salvation in Amida Buddha, is representative of the tariki, or “other-power,” approach.</description>

      <title>Jesus’ identity according to Soka Nichiren Buddhism</title>

      <description>“Bodhisattva Jesus”: Jesus’ life was a record of struggle for the sake of people, trying to save them from ignorance and suffering. This essential life-tendency of altruism and compassion - which Jesus expressed despite facing great challenges -
is what Buddhism considers as the highest way leading to enlightenment, being the “Bodhisattva way”.
According to Mahayana tradition, Bodhisattvas make four universal vows:
(1) to save innumerable living beings, (2) to attain mastery over desires, (3) to master immeasurable teachings, and (4) to attain supreme enlightenment.</description>

      <description>Amida Buddhism and the Three Properties of Buddha
Mahayana Buddhism refers to the Buddha as possessing three enlightened qualities (sanjin). The three properties (Wisdom, Compassion and Manifest Action in daily life) - are also called the Three Enlightened Aspects (or Three Bodies) of Buddha.
Obviously, the three qualities of Buddhahood are interconnected, because Wisdom cannot be separate from Compassion, and both Wisdom and Compassion require Action (or a Manifest body to express them in reality).</description>

      <description>The shift in Traditional Buddhism towards accepting the concepts of the Lotus Sutra, supports the view that the Buddha’s final teaching (of the Lotus Sutra) was preached to unify all previous Buddhist teachings.
For this reason the Lotus Sutra refers to the Theravada&amp;rsquo;s concept of Nirvana, and it also refers to the early-Mahayana concept of Amida’s Pure Land – for the purpose of unifying and transforming both concepts into its ultimate teaching of the universal dharma (the Mystic Law):</description>

      <description>Christian literature refers to the concept of “Law” in sense of morality as well as in sense of the objective natural principles created by God:
“Everything in the universe, every plant and animal, every rock, every particle of matter or light wave, is bound by laws which it has no choice but to obey. The Bible tells us that there are laws of nature—“ordinances of heaven and earth” (Jeremiah 33:25). These laws describe the way God normally accomplishes His will in the universe.</description>

      <description>In order to lead people to enlightenment, Shakyamuni Buddha gradually conveyed his teachings over a period of over 40 years, preparing his listeners step by step to understand his final teaching. The Buddha’s first sermon (The Four Noble Truths) was generally directed to monks, who renounced the secular world and aspired for breaking the cycle of rebirth (Sravaka disciples). For ordinary people, however, who live in the social fabric of daily life, the teaching of renouncing the secular world and extinguishing desires was an impossible path to follow.</description>

      <description>Zen literature presents an interpretation of the Buddha’s Flower Sermon, as the starting point of their tradition.
In the Flower Sermon Shakyamuni upheld a lotus flower before his disciples - silently, without saying anything. It is said that one of them, Mahakashyapa, reacted by smiling - without giving any comment about what he understood.
According to Zen literature, this sermon established a “new way of teaching Buddhism”: through “silent-communication” or “mind-to-mind” transmission:</description>

      <description>The Lotus Sutra refers to its own principles as being difficult to believe:
“A passage from the Lotus Sutra reads that it is “the most difficult to believe and the most difficult to understand.” WND1p471 a statement of anticipation of reaction to its challenging and revolutionary teachings.
The main principles of the Lotus Sutra are:
“Attaining Buddhahood in this life time” (a different perspective from previous sutras, which required many lifetimes of practice), - “Enlightenment of all People”, eradicating limitations on attaining Buddhahood, which were set in previous sutras.</description>

      <description>Tibetan literature provides its explanation of the process of discovering the reincarnated Lamas. The process of “choosing a child” as the reincarnation of a deceased Lama is based on a judgement of a committee of monks - about how the examined child reacted to personal items of the deceased lama. The reaction of the child is considered as an indication of a “memory of himself” in a past existence:
“Once the High Lamas have located the boy, they present a number of artefacts to the child.</description>

      <description>The “Universal Law” is the cosmic power that moves the world, pulsates in all phenomena and in the lives of living beings. It is also called the “Wonderful Law” or the “Mystic Law of Life”.
The word “Law” implies the “Order” we perceive in nature, weaving all natural phenomena, and operating within all living entities.
In Buddhist terminology, the truth of reality of life is called the “Dharma”, and the Dharma that was revealed in the Lotus Sutra is this “Wonderful Law of Life”.</description>

      <description>Zen rejection of the role of voice and written teachings in Buddhist practice - constitutes the basic a major difference between Zen and Nichiren Buddhism.
Zen asserts that the essence of Buddhism was transmitted from mind to mind, claiming that the Buddha’s enlightenment was telepathically transferred in this way to Mahakashyapa and then to each successive Zen patriarch.
Nichiren explains: “…the Zen school describes itself as a teaching transmitted apart from the sutras, and hence speaks with scorn of the Lotus Sutra.</description>

      <description>Zen values can be perceived from the essence of the information and messages contained in Zen literature - such as in koan. Obviously, a particular koan may describe a real event (which could have taken place in reality), but it may also express just a metaphor for the values (or essence), which the koan contains. In either case, the described statements in koans offer a glimpse into the qualities contained in the teachings of Zen masters as conveyed to disciples generation after the other.</description>

      <description>Buddhism explains the mechanism of how a human revolution in one individual can change one’s destiny and radiate into great causes affecting society and the environment:
The eighth consciousness [Alaya] transcends the boundaries of the individual and interacts with the karmic energy of others. On the inner dimension of life, one’s ethnic group and humankind, and also with that of animals and plants&amp;hellip; That’s why the human revolution of one person also changes the destiny of the person’s family and society.</description>

      <title>Chanting as “the Cause”&lt;br /&gt;for revealing one’s Buddhanature</title>
      <link>https://lotusbuddhism.info/article/power-of-voice/</link>

      <guid>https://lotusbuddhism.info/article/power-of-voice/</guid>
      <description>The practice of chanting is common among all indigenous spiritual practices and in all major religions. The famous Christian call Hellolujah literally means “Voice your praise to the Lord” in Aramaic, Arabic and Hebrew languages. Chanting in itself is accepted as a valid spiritual practice.
Doubts about the practice of chanting reveals rather uncertainty and doubts about one’s belief in own Buddhanature. If one believes that the Buddhanature is a potential existing in one’s life, then the question is: how to reveal one’s Buddhanature?</description>

      <description>Among different categories that can be used for comparison between various spiritual scriptures - the criteria of peace, security and equality of people - are the most important. This would lead to a focus on how various scriptures target the following domains impacting the life of people:
peace in society, reaction to disputes among people, and equality among various classes of society. -﻿&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;-
Peace and Non-violence
Viewed from the Lotus Sutra’s contents, the subject of “peace among people” - is indisputably prevalent in all its teachings.</description>

On this subject Ikeda states: “…the belief that people should serve religion leads to fanaticism” (My Dear Friends in America, page 152).
In a further explanation, Ikeda describes the fanatics as having
“unstable and unconfident state of mind… Fanatic people are characterised by their
refusal to enter into dialogue. Discussion is impossible for fanatics.

      <title>Diversity of People’s Desires in the Lotus Sutra</title>

      <guid>https://lotusbuddhism.info/article/respecting-diversity/</guid>
      <description>Acknowledging the phenomenon of diversity of desires, the Lotus Sutra regards the differences in tendencies among people as a welcome aspect of reality of human existence:
“People have differing natures. Differing desires. Differing modes of behaviour. And differing ideas and outlooks” : “ I sho shu jo. U shu ju sho. Shu ju yoku. Shu ju gyo. Shu ju oku so.” – Chapter 16: Life Span.
The concept of celebrating diversity and treasuring the uniqueness of each person was also taught by Nichiren - who based his teachings on the Lotus Sutra.</description>

      <description>Nichiren Shu
A “Disciple” in Nichiren Shu school of Buddhism is a novice priest (who leaves home and the secular world), while “Master” is a priest of a more advanced status. In this view, Master Disciple is understood to be within the line of priesthood-based order:
Becoming a Minister in the Nichiren Order:
“…The rules for the master/disciple relationship are strict. A shami&amp;rsquo;s practice is to observe, listen, study, serve and obey his/her master….</description>

      <description>Living in this world is expressed by the working of one’s body&amp;amp;mind. The Mind of the individual has various levels of depth. As the Buddhist view suggests, the various levels of mind (Nine Consciousnesses) can be simplified here to the following model of three fields of mind:
Awareness about the world (the 5 senses and intellect), Consciousness about the self, (the Mano level of mind), and Subconsciousness (the Alaya, or storehouse of tendencies).</description>

      <description>In historical terms, the teachings of the Lotus Sutra were recorded by the Buddha’s followers starting with the phrase “This is What I Heard&amp;quot;. Ikeda explains that :
”The essence of ‘This is what I heard’ is the oneness of mentor and disciple, and that is the quintessence of the transmission of Buddhism. The drama of the oneness of mentor and disciple, in which there is a mutual resonance and response to save all living beings is epitomised in this expression, ‘This is what I heard.</description>

      <description>Mindfulness is about “awareness of the moment”. It focuses on breathing, attention to the surrounding, as well as awareness of the inner thoughts of the mind. It is basically about passively observing the mind, accepting it as it is. Chanting is also about “awareness of the moment” and its implication on one’s life. It automatically and effortlessly harmonises the rhythm of breathing and the rhythm of heart beat. Harmony of those physiological functions dissolves tension, and this can be visibly noticed on the face features of individuals after chanting.</description>

      <description>Traditional views in various societies tend to merge the image of “Buddhist” as being “Vegetarian”. Where did this idea come from?
Tracing back the history of Buddhism, we find that the Brahmin, or “the seekers of the truth” in ancient India - where Shakyamuni Buddha lived – were all devoted individuals who chose to dwell in forests and retreats, spending their time in deep meditation and in teachings of their disciples.</description>

- the Buddha,
- the Law, and :
- the Samgha (Buddhist Order, or Community of Believers)
The Treasure of “Buddhist Order” is understood by the priesthood to exclude laity:
The Priesthood: The Treasure of the Priest includes all the Head Priests and assistant Priests, who with absolute
faith in and obedience to the instruction of the High Priest ,
are dispatched to each local temple as his representatives.</description>

      <description>The Three Treasures in Buddhism are The Buddha, The Dharma and The Sangha (community of Believers). The central difference in doctrine between the two schools of Nichiren Shu and SGI is found in the interpretation of the Treasure of the Buddha. The Buddha is understood here as the “Teacher of Buddhism”.
In Nichiren Shu beliefs, the teacher Buddha is Shakyamuni - and in SGI teachings the teacher Buddha is Nichiren.</description>

      <description>Nichiren viewed Maitreya as “one of the protective forces” and a function of “guarding and helping” the Bodhisattvas of the Earth:
“Moreover… all the bodhisattvas, Bodhisattva Maitreya … will guard and protect the
votaries of the Lotus Sutra, so one may indeed rest assured”. WND1 p1074
In his writing, Nichiren mentions the traditional Buddhist views on Maitreya - however, he clearly explains that the future propagation of the Eternal Dharma of the Lotus Sutra was entrusted by Shakyamuni - not to Maitreya, but - to the “Bodhisattvas” of the Earth :</description>

      <description>Generally speaking, Traditional Buddhism (Pre-Lotus teachings) regard Karma as the “property of the past”. Nichiren teachings focus the explanation of Karma as being the “property of the present moment”:
“Karma is being formed at each moment in the course of life’s perpetual motion. In the present instant also, new karma is being fashioned as it transforms karma from the past”. (Source: Space and Eternal Life, Ikeda and Wickramasingh , page 119)</description>

      <description>The word “authenticity” of a doctrine refers to “originality” and “truthfulness”. When applied to Buddhist teachings, authenticity is about how a doctrine accords with the final Buddhist goal of overcoming sufferings and attaining enlightenment.
Disagreement between Theravada and Mahayana on authenticity of sutras
As academic sources reveal, about 100 years after the Buddha’s passing, a dispute took place between two groups in the Buddhist Council. The predecessors of today’s Theravada and Mahayana branches argued about the extent of truthfulness of the sutras employed by the monks - and which were all recited from memory with no written reference.</description>

      <title>The Concept of Karma in Nichiren Buddhism</title>

      <description>All Buddhist schools teach that one’s present situation is the result of one’s past actions, or Karma. Nichiren Buddhism takes this concept further, to free oneself from the past, focusing on the present and the future.
This present moment will be considered as “the past” from the perspective of tomorrow or any time in the future. Following the original premise that past actions affect the present, it is true then that one’s actions at the present moment affects one’s situation of the future.</description>

      <title>The Difference between Western and Buddhist models of Conception</title>

      <description>The Western model of understanding of how conception of an embryo takes place, is basically reduced to a chemical reaction: all needed for a child to be born is the availability of just two factors: a male’s spermatozoon and a female’s ovum - in other words: father and mother.
In Buddhist perspective, however, three factors are needed for birth of a child: father, mother and the child. Conception requires the matching of three lives.</description>

      <description>Nichiren explained that the teaching of the Four Noble Truths was merely one of several specific teachings, which Shakyamuni taught in accordance with his listeners’ capacity and stage of practice:
“In the various other sutras we find [many doctrines] &amp;hellip; the four noble truths [taught] for voice-hearers&amp;hellip;”
In his Comparison of the Lotus Sutra with Other Sutras Nichiren clearly states that the Four Noble Truths were not dedicated to all categories of Buddha’s disciples, but merely to the immediate Voice-Hearers (Sravaka).</description>

      <description>All Buddhist Traditions acknowledge the doctrine of the Three Treasures being the Buddha, the Law (Dharma) and the Community of Believers. Our knowledge of the Buddha’s teachings about the Law would have been impossible without an organisation of dedicated practitioners, who would preserve and continue the propagation of Buddhism.
It is impossible to practice Buddhism in isolation. Our life is based on interconnectedness and our relationships require enrichment and continual development.</description>

      <description>“I firmly believe that a great human revolution in just a single individual can help achieve a change in the destiny of a nation and enable a change in all humankind”. P. Ikeda’s famous statement on this possibility of change is based on the truth of interconnectedness - and on Buddhism’s peaceful principles in the way an individual can affect others.
Rather than blaming others or trying to “change the system” - the key concept in Human Revolution is to take responsibility for one’s life as an individual and become the master of one’s own destiny, helping others in the process.</description>

      <description>According to Nichiren Buddhism, we currently live in the period of time called Mappo or the Latter Day of the Law . In his writing, Nichiren figuratively mentioned that this period of time is 10.000 years or more, however, it should be noted that the word 10.000 was used in the Japanese literature at that time to indicate “a great number” - and not specifically a mathematical value. For example:</description>

      <title>The Lotus Sutra and the Inherent Nature of Human Rights</title>

      <guid>https://lotusbuddhism.info/article/inheret-nature-human-rights/</guid>
      <description>What constitutes a “right” ? In philosophy and in the legal domain, a “right” of a human being is viewed as a ‘state to which an individual is entitled’.
The reason why this “entitlement to rights” (by virtue of existence as a human being) is justified – is found in the concept of “inherent worth” of being a living entity, just as one is. Because the individual’s life is precious, it follows that the individual deserves appreciation and respect.</description>

      <description>History records many movements aimed at the renewal and revitalisation of various fields of activities and also the betterment of society.
The word “revolution” was given to the radical movements of changing the environment as well as of dramatic changes in scientific or technical aspects of human activities. However, humanity did not necessarily solve its basic problems through these changes or revolutions which occurred in history:

      <description>Needless to say, the international conventions on human rights contain lists of various rights of citizen (which abuse would lead to the suffering of affected individuals). However, realisation of these rights (through the State’s protection) would obviously not lead the individual to avoiding sufferings, and would not guarantee achieving happiness.
Buddhism differentiates between two kinds of happiness: relative and unconditioned:
Relative happiness depends on favourite external circumstances and relations with others, while unconditioned happiness is a state of deep inner fulfilment, independent of the reaction of others.</description>

      <title>The Significance of Silent Prayers On the Silent Prayers</title>

      <description>by Daisaku Ikeda
Silent prayers are the essence of our values in life. Accordingly, even though we may read their words, it is what we actually think - the thoughts occurring to us - that become our prayers:
P.Toda warns against lack of focus during silent prayers:
“But let’s be careful when offering silent prayers. The thoughts in our heart are clearly expressed to the Gohonzon. If during the silent prayers we think “that fellow’s a real rascal” – then even though we may be reading the silent prayers’ words, it is the thought in our heart (that ‘he is a real rascal’) that becomes our prayer to the Gohonzon.</description>

      <description>In various letters of his writings, Nichiren outlines the unique and revolutionary teachings contained in the Lotus Sutra, and which makes it a class of its own in Mahayana Buddhism:
A Comparison of the Lotus and Other Sutras
The Blessings of the Lotus Sutra
The Proof of the Lotus Sutra
This wealth of scholastic background explains the reason why classification of Buddhist sutras - according to Nichiren - was simplified into : Pre-Lotus sutras (both Theravada and Mahayana) - and the Lotus, as the final and complete teaching of Buddhism.</description>

      <description>The individual human being is metaphorically expressed in the sutra’s text as a “Treasure Tower”, emerging from the “Earth of reality”.
The “Treasure Tower” chapter describes a projection (from the Buddha’s mind) of a vision of a magnificent and extraordinarily structure (adorned with precious metals and jewels) - serenely emerging upwards from beneath the surface of the earth. The imagery goes to show that the unexplainable structure serenely reaching high above the earth, as if ‘connecting the earth with the sky.</description>

      <description>Various schools of Mahayana Buddhism employ meditation and observing the precepts to create gradual “purification of one’s karma”, a process which takes the span of many lifetimes.
According to Nichiren Buddhism, however, it is possible to change one’s karmic tendencies in this lifetime - and hence it is possible to change the direction of one’s “karmic river”, which leads one to a certain direction (or pattern) of happenings.
Because Karma is the energy that drives us to actions, and because actions follow the Law of Cause and Effect (MyohoRengeKyo), then employing this Law of Cause and Effect (through chanting) is in itself an action of orienting our life, aimed at becoming in harmony with the Law (that binds events with their latent consequences).</description>
